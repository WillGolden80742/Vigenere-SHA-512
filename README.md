# Vigenere Cipher Application

This Java application provides a simple graphical user interface for encrypting and decrypting text using the Vigenere cipher. The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Vigenere Cipher Application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WillGolden80742/vigenere-cipher.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

3. Build and run the application.

## How to Use

1. Launch the application.

2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "Input" text area.

3. Enter the key in the "Chave" field.

4. Click the "Cifrar" button to encrypt the text or "Decifrar" to decrypt.

5. The result will be displayed in the "Output" text area.

## Features

- **Cifrar (Encrypt):** Encode the input text using the Vigenere cipher with the specified key.

- **Decifrar (Decrypt):** Decode the input text using the Vigenere cipher with the specified key.

- **Loading Animation:** A loading animation and progress percentage are displayed during the encryption or decryption process.

## Additional Information

- **Hash Function:** The application uses the SHA-512 hash function to generate a hash of the key.

- **Base64 Encoding:** The result of the encryption is encoded using Base64 for a more user-friendly representation.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have provided a valid key and that the input text is not empty.
